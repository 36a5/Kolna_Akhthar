## Project Overview

We utilized a YOLO11 model, training it on images of potholes and roads to detect potholes using OpenCV. The project aims to contribute to the greening of Saudi Arabia, aligning with the motto "Kolna Akhthar".

### Project Details

In this project, we employed a YOLO11 model, which was trained on a dataset comprising images of potholes and roads. The model leverages OpenCV for pothole detection, registering the location of each pothole and saving an image of it on a map. Our goal is to support the environmental initiative to make Saudi Arabia greener. This project is developed by students from King Saud University (KSU) specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning.

### About Us

We are students from King Saud University (KSU) studying Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Note
- Waste detection and greenery percentage features will be added soon.

This is an underdevelopment project, and we are going to add a lot of features in the future, إن شاء الله.
